PyCity Schools Analysis

The task of this work is to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. 
The main goal is to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions 
regarding future school budgets and priorities.

District summary:

* Total number of unique schools: 15
* Total number of students: 39170
* Total budget: $24649428
* Average math score: 78.99
* Average reading score: 81.88
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math): 74.98
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading): 85.81
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading): 65.17

The school summary gives detailed information about each school, including all 
metrics as in the district summary. Also, such important features were identified:  
highest and lowest performing schools, math and reading scores by grade, scores 
by school spending, school size, and school type.

Conclusions:
1. The top five performing schools are all charter schools, and the bottom five 
are district schools.  So the school type is a significant factor in student performance.
2. Schools with a lower student budget have higher overall passing rates than schools 
with a higher budget. So large spending does not guarantee better results.
